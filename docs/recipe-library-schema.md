# Recipe Library Schema

The scraper writes a JSON payload with metadata and a `recipes` array.

## Parse Status

- `ok` means at least eight recognized settings were parsed.
- `needs_review` means the page may contain multiple recipes, unusual formatting, or a settings block that did not match the parser.

## App Mapping Notes

Settings are stored as strings first. Numeric conversion and Fuji PTP property mapping should happen in a separate import/mapping layer so that unusual values such as `Auto, +1 Red & -2 Blue` and `0 to +2/3` are preserved.
