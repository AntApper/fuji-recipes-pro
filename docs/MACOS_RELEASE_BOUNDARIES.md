# macOS Release Boundaries

This repository can build a Developer ID signing candidate and validate its
local bundle evidence. It cannot prove notarization, distribute a release, or
make raw USB camera access reliable without the external Apple account,
certificate, and hardware steps described below.

## Current development boundary

- The macOS app launches a bundled `x100vi_helper` executable that uses raw
  libusb access to communicate with an X100VI. Release packaging places the
  helper in `Fuji Recipes.app/Contents/Resources`, alongside its bundled
  libusb dylib; the finished-bundle validator rejects a missing or
  developer-path-linked copy. The transport's broader development fallback
  search remains outside this packaging-only readiness work.
- `ptpcamerad` may claim the USB PTP interface. Development testing currently
  requires stopping that service before the helper can claim the device.
- The helper now loads a bundled `libusb-1.0.0.dylib` through
  `@rpath/libusb-1.0.0.dylib` with an `@loader_path` rpath. Its source,
  helper, and runtime SHA-256 values are recorded in the app resource
  provenance manifest, and the bundled license text is checked.
- A release still requires a verified universal helper and libusb runtime.
  `scripts/verify-macos-release-foundation.sh` rejects missing `arm64` or
  `x86_64` slices and any Mach-O whose minimum macOS version is later than
  14.0. A locally installed Homebrew libusb can be arm64-only and built for a
  newer macOS; that input is intentionally rejected by the release gate.

## What the credential-free checks prove

`scripts/verify-macos-app-bundle.sh` validates a completed `.app` bundle:

- concrete bundle identifier, marketing version, and numeric build number;
- the expected helper, libusb runtime, provenance manifest, and license notice;
- bundled provenance hashes, `arm64`/`x86_64` coverage when requested, and a
  macOS 14.0-or-earlier deployment target;
- no Homebrew or `/Users/...` load commands/rpaths in the executable, helper,
  or libusb runtime; and
- strict app and nested-code signature/resource-seal verification.

It can additionally require Developer ID Application authorities and hardened
runtime flags, but it never calls Apple's notarization service. An ad-hoc
signature can pass the structural check and is explicitly **not** a
distributable signature.

For a local candidate bundle:

```bash
cd FujiRecipesMac/macos
./package_app.sh release --version 1.0.0 --build-number 1
```

For an externally provisioned Developer ID candidate:

```bash
SIGNING_IDENTITY="Developer ID Application: Your Organization (TEAMID)" \
  ./package_app.sh release --version 1.0.0 --build-number 1
scripts/verify-macos-app-bundle.sh \
  --app "build/Fuji Recipes.app" \
  --require-universal --require-developer-id \
  --expected-version 1.0.0 --expected-build 1
```

The package script builds both architectures for Release. It is a SwiftPM
packaging smoke-test, not an `.xcarchive`/installer producer; use Xcode
Archive or a dedicated external release workflow when creating the artifact
submitted to Apple.

## Distribution status

- **Local development:** Supported for engineering validation when a compatible
  helper, libusb runtime, and direct USB access are available.
- **Developer ID:** The repository can prepare and locally validate a signing
  candidate. Actual distribution remains blocked on an Apple-issued Developer
  ID Application certificate, hardened-runtime signing, timestamping,
  notarization, staple verification, and hardware testing.
- **Mac App Store:** Not supported. The raw libusb/helper process and
  `ptpcamerad` conflict have not been shown to work within the App Sandbox or
  its entitlement model.
- **iOS:** A separate workstream. Its transport, signing, privacy disclosures,
  and device testing are independent of this macOS helper path.

## Notarization

Notarization is intentionally outside repository CI. It requires an enrolled
Apple Developer Program team, a Developer ID Application certificate and
private key in the signing keychain, a timestamp-capable signing environment,
and either an App Store Connect API key or app-specific password. The final
signed archive must be submitted with `notarytool`, accepted by Apple, stapled,
then assessed on a clean macOS installation. Do not add those credentials,
private keys, API keys, or passwords to this repository or its workflows.

Enabling `ENABLE_HARDENED_RUNTIME` in the Release target only configures the
build requirement. It does not sign the application, grant USB access, or
establish notarization acceptance.

## Raw libusb / PTP platform caveat

The current camera transport claims the USB PTP interface directly through
libusb. On macOS, `ptpcamerad` can automatically claim that same interface;
development testing has sometimes required manually stopping it. This is an
operational limitation, not a shipping solution. The behavior has not been
validated under App Sandbox restrictions and may require a different transport
or privileged/system integration for dependable distribution. No camera-access
claim is made by the credential-free packaging checks.

## Required evidence before a public macOS release

1. Supply a redistributable universal libusb dylib built for macOS 14.0 or
   earlier, then rebuild the helper with `scripts/build-macos-helper.sh`.
2. Archive the final app, sign all nested code with Developer ID Application
   plus hardened runtime, then run the finished-bundle check with
   `--require-developer-id`.
3. Submit the signed archive to Apple, wait for accepted notarization, staple
   the resulting ticket, and independently assess the stapled artifact.
4. Verify the helper's architecture coverage and camera behavior on supported
   Intel and Apple Silicon machines.
5. Define and test a signed, sandbox-compatible distribution design, or
   explicitly limit distribution to a non-App-Store channel.
6. Validate camera behavior without relying on manually killing
   `ptpcamerad`.
